# Pi-hole Block Lists

These lists are very unforgiving but are in fact updated multiple times per day if you use the bleeding-edge.

| List | Note | Experimental |
|------|------| -------------|
| masterlist-block | List made from other lists | ❌ |
| masterlist-allow | List of allowed domains | ❌ |
| custom-blocklist | List of domains classified by my script | ✅ |
